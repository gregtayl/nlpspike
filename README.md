# nlpspike

To run locally:

- Ensure python 3.7 is installed (if running from Windows, ensure Python is in path)
- pip install flask
- Download and install Anaconda3
- Open the Anaconda Prompt (as an administrator)
	- cd to the nlpspike\lexnlp directory 
	- run: python setup.py install
	- NOTE: I had to explicitly install regex and reporters_db after the above setup failed
